  - Modes needs to be updated for users and channels.

  - Add DCC

    - I would really like usocket first

  - If a message (as in PRIVMSG) is longer than 512 characters
  (including carriage return and linefeed) we should probably split
  the message into several on behalf of the user.

    - should send-irc-message automatically do this for you?

  - Add ignore

  - Document inconsistencies between IRC servers (ref. undernet
  servers send out channel name in arguments rather than
  trailing-messages on a part/quit message)

  - When doing a whois on a user the library ought to snap up the
  channels in WHOISCHANNELS as channels the user is currently on.
