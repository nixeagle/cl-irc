  - Add DCC

    minimally: CHAT (accept), GET

    - We have (some) DCC, but no means to initiate a DCC connection:
      trivial-sockets won't let us access the local ip-address associated
      with the main IRC connection. Presumably, the DCC listener should
      be bound to the same IP/interface.

      After solving this, SEND and CHAT (initiate) can be implemented.

    - In the process add configuration options for automatically accepting
      DCC connections (both :send and :chat types)

  - If a message (as in PRIVMSG) is longer than 512 characters
  (including carriage return and linefeed) we should probably split
  the message into several on behalf of the user.

    - should send-irc-message automatically do this for you?

  - Add ignore

  - Document inconsistencies between IRC servers (ref. undernet
  servers send out channel name in arguments rather than
  trailing-messages on a part/quit message)

  - When doing a whois on a user the library ought to snap up the
  channels in WHOISCHANNELS as channels the user is currently on.

  - Extend the mode tracking and isupport frameworks to detect server
  type and adjust mode-name maps accordingly.
